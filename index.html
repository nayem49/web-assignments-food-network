            <p>There is no diet that will do what healthy eating does. Healthy, sustainable weight loss is all about
                lifestyle.
                It takes time and commitment. But you’ll be surprised how a few simple adjustments towards healthier
                eating
                can
                result in positive change.</p>

            energy you have over the day and how in shape you stay.</p>
